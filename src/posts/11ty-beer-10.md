Finally, the first stable version of 11ty Beer just dropped, even before 2025!  
Basically, i built this blog because all i want for an blog just:

- Responsive
- Simple structure & code
- Simple configuration

What the features you gonna get from use this starter? Simple, just:
- Material designed with [BeerCSS](https://github.com/beercss/beercss)
- [PWA (Progressive Web App)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app)
- [Posts](https://11ty-beer.vercel.app/posts/) (exactly)
- [Tags](https://11ty-beer.vercel.app/tags/)

And, some more features which I don't pay much attention to

- Simple shortcode for image with size
- [Theme customization](https://www.beercss.com/#colors) (for user)
- Easy navigation for posts and tags [(by dialog)](https://www.beercss.com/#dialogs)
- Nice accessibility
- SEO-first configuration
